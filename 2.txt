The arrogant, proud, and mostly illiterate Jack Keefe of Bedford, Indiana had already established a career pitching for the minor league baseball club in Terre Haute. His strong pitching arm attracted the attention of Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey and before he knew it, Keefe had been signed to play for the team. Through the ups and downs of his life, from his baseball career, to his marriage and family, to his service in World War I and his eventual return to baseball, Jack Keefe documents everything in a series of letters to his old pal back home, Al Blanchard.

Behind Keefe’s rube-like dialect, these stories offer a glimpse at significant figures and moments in the era’s baseball culture. Jack faces off against legends like Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson, and Babe Ruth. He travels around the world as part of the 1913–1914 Baseball World Tour with the Chicago White Sox and New York Giants. He even fights in the trenches during World War I. The final stories take place during his 1919 season with the White Sox, a team who would become infamous for the game-fixing conspiracy in the 1919 World Series dubbed the “Black Sox Scandal.”
